<p>When we came in 2013 we came to minister to our IES Kids. It's been amazing to watch them grow, just as we've seen our own kids grow. Now some of the kids we started with are on the verge of their senior year in High School. It was greeat to see so many of our IES Kids now IES Teens ministering last week during our Teens Takeover Weekend.</p>

<p>When we came in 2013 we came to minister to our IES Kids. It's been amazing to watch them grow, just as we've seen our own kids grow. Now some of the kids we started with are on the verge of their senior year in High School. It was greeat to see so many of our IES Kids now IES Teens ministering last week during our Teens Takeover Weekend.</p>

<p>Most of the teens on the stage were with us in Kids Church back in the day.  Some of those that weren't connected with IES when I was able to speak in their schools.  It's a great privilage we have to minister here. </p>
<p>In IES Kids we say we are helping parents grow their kids in Christ and developing ministers for the kingdom of God.  Teens Takeover Weekend was a great example of how that purpose continues in the lives of kids as they grow from IES Kids to IES Teens and beyond.</p>
<p>We're so excited to see each one of these kids growing all the time.</p>
