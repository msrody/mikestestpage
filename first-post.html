Our kids have grown and grown.  We've endured hardships together, had some great trips and won a few victories along the way. Life is not always easy but we really believe God called us here and being where God puts you is the best place you can be.</p><p>When we came in 2013 we came to minister to our IES Kids. It's been amazing to watch them grow, just as we've seen our own kids grow. Now some of the kids we started with are on the verge of their senior year in High School. It was greeat to see so many of our IES Kids now IES Teens ministering last week during our Teens Takeover Weekend.</p><figure class="post__image--wide"><img class="lazyload" src="https://msrody.github.io/mikestestpage/media/posts/1/responsive/TeensTakeOver2019-xs.jpg" data-sizes="auto" data-srcset="https://msrody.github.io/mikestestpage/media/posts/1/responsive/TeensTakeOver2019-xs.jpg 300w ,https://msrody.github.io/mikestestpage/media/posts/1/responsive/TeensTakeOver2019-sm.jpg 480w ,https://msrody.github.io/mikestestpage/media/posts/1/responsive/TeensTakeOver2019-md.jpg 768w ,https://msrody.github.io/mikestestpage/media/posts/1/responsive/TeensTakeOver2019-lg.jpg 1024w" alt="Teens Takeover Weekend 201903" width="3509" height="1541"></figure><p>Most of the teens on the stage were with us in Kids Church back in the day.  Some of those that weren't connected with IES when I was able to speak in their schools.  It's a great privilage we have to minister here. </p><p>In IES Kids we say we are helping parents grow their kids in Christ and developing ministers for the kingdom of God.  Teens Takeover Weekend was a great example of how that purpose continues in the lives of kids as they grow from IES Kids to IES Teens and beyond.</p><p>We're so excited to see each one of these kids growing all the time.</p><p> </p></div><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on April 5, 2019</div><div class="post__footer__col"><div class="post__share"></div></div><div class="post__bio"><div><h3><a href="https://msrody.github.io/mikestestpage/authors/mike-rody/" class="inverse" title="mike rody">mike rody</a></h3></div></div></footer></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><div align="left">Copyright 2019 - Mike &amp; Chelly Rody</div><div align="right">-a Publii site.</div></div></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://msrody.github.io/mikestestpage/assets/js/jquery-3.2.1.slim.min.js?v=f307ecc7f6353949f03c06ffa70652a2"></script><script defer="defer" src="https://msrody.github.io/mikestestpage/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f503b0ac46db9f99180b3b9f932c7f9a"></script></body></html>
